### Run the React UI (Frontend)

The React app is configured to proxy backend requests to the local Node server. (See [`"proxy"` config](react-ui/package.json))

In a separate terminal from the API server, start the UI:

```bash
# Always change directory, first
cd react-ui/

# Initial setup
npm install

# Start the server
npm start
```
